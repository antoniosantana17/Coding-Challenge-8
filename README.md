The Simple Event Registration Portal enables people to sign up for events by providing their name and email address, choosing an event date, and indicating their preferred food. When an entry is made, the portal verifies all of the data and shows the registration information on the same page. Constructed using HTML and JavaScript, it offers an intuitive interface for effectively handling event registrations.
